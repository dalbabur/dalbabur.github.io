My name is Diego Alba Burbano and I'm <b>Chemical Engineering and Data Science</b> graduate student at the <b>University of Washington</b> working with <b><a href="http://carothersresearch.com">James Carothers</a></b>.
Currently, I build dynamic CRISPRa/i circuits in cell-free systems. The idea is to make biological devices that can interact with their environment over time. I go into more detail <a href="research.html"> over here. </a></p>

<p align="justify"> 
I graduated from <b>Johns Hopkins</b> in 2019 with a bachelors in <b><a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/chembe/"> Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering</a></b> and a minor in Mathematics. 
With an interest in developing platforms to better understand biology at the single-cell level, I worked in <b><a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/chembe/faculty/david-gracias-2/">David Gracias'</a></b> lab and learned about photolithography and nanofabrication to build devices that could interface with biology.
In collaboration with <a href+"https://www.imec-int.com/en">IMEC</a>, we engineered <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/advs.201700731">self-folding electrodes</a> capable of wrapping around and record individual heart cells.
Later with <b><a href="https://imbiotech.me.jhu.edu">Claire Hur</a></b> I learned to design and fabricate microfluidic devices and how we could use inertial focusing for high-throughput single-cell assays. In her lab I also developed <a href="https://github.com/dalbabur/Asymmetric-Paricles-NN">convolutional neural netwroks</a> and autoencoders for image processing.
Then I decided it was time to engineer biology itself.

My first real contact with an engineered organism was freshman year, when we studied the feasibility of engineering <i>A. ferrooxidan</i> to produce biofuels.
Later I'd learn how to combine thermodynamics and kinetics with biochemistry to build metabolic network models, how to model the metabolism of <i>E. coli</i>, how to use linear programming to maximize cell growth rate and production of ATP, and how to simulate the effect of DNA mutations.
I'd also gain wet lab experience by engineering <i>E. coli</i> to produce a variant of SNase. Now I apply these skills in my PhD projects.  

<p align="justify"> 
Throughout both undegrad and grad school I've received awards for my academic, research, and leadership accomplishments.
They showcase perhaps my greatest strength: because I'm analytical, goal-driven, and resourceful I can adapt to new environement and quickly learn the necessary skills to overcome whatever challenges I'm faced with.</b>
